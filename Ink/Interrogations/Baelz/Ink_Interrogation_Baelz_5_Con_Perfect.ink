- <Baelz:Happy:0> Well girls. It's been fun, but I have to go.
- <Baelz:Neutral:0> I hope my house is still up when I go back...
- <Baelz:Neutral:0> By the way, do you know why does the office smell, like, I don't know... fish?

- <Mococo:Neutral:0> Maybe it's because Gura-senpai it's here?
- <Fuwawa:Neutral:0> That's rude Moco-chan...
- <Mococo:Neutral:0> Noeh, I didn't mean it like that...

- <Baelz:Laugh:0> Hahaha... maybe it's that. OK you two, hope you have luck with your investigation. Bye!
- <FWMC:Happy:0> Bye bye Baelz-senpai! BAU BAU!
