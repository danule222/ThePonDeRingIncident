<img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzE4NDIyOTYyLnBuZw==/original/YoCBvU.png">

<p>Investigation and Visual Novel game inspired in some of the talents of the VTuber agency Hololive.</p>

<p>Fuwawa and Mococo, on the occasion of the closure of the Mister Donut in Akihabara, decided to gold-plate a Pon de Ring, their favourite sweet from this place.</p>

<p>One day, when they arrive at the office, they find that the Pon de Ring has disappeared.</p>

<p>To recover it, they decide to investigate the office in search of evidence that might help them to interrogate the talents who were in the office that day.</p>

<p>Since they have to talk to all of them before they go home, they will have only 2 minutes to find any evidence.</p>

<p>With the help of these plus the different conversations you can have with each of them, you will have to decide who is the culprit.</p>
